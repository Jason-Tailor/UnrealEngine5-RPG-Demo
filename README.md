# UnrealEngine5-RPG-Demo
This is an interactive RPG prototype developed in Unreal Engine 5 using Blueprint-based systems. It demonstrates complex, interconnected gameplay and system softwares including AI behaviour, event-driven UI, state management, and player progression mechanics. The project was built through independent implementation, customisation, and debugging, using a structured Unreal Engine 5 tutorial as a foundation.

## Development Notes
- This repository is for documentation and presentation purposes
- Full Unreal Engine 5 project files are not included due to size and asset licensing constraints
- This project was developed using a structured Unreal Engine 5 tutorial as a foundation. All gameplay mechanics were implemented manually and extended through customisation, debugging, and adaptation across the engine versions and assets

## What I Learned
This project helped me develop a deeper understanding of systems-based design and Unreal Engine 5 workflows through hands-on implementation and iteration:
- Designed and connected multiple interactive systems using Blueprint-based architecture
- Implemented AI behaviour and state logic with animation-driven feedback
- Built and managed interactive UI systems, including menus and inventory tracking
- Structured and persisted system states such as player progression and quests
- Debugged complex Blueprint logic and adapted systems across engine versions
- Managed large open-world environments with Landscape and Foliage tools
- Balanced scope and polish when developing a long-form, systems-heavy prototype
- Applied event-driven programming and systems-thinking skills transferable to software engineering roles
