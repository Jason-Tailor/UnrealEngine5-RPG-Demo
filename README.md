# UnrealEngine5-RPG-Demo
This is an Unreal Engine 5 RPG prototype, using Blueprint-based systems. It features Third Person Movement, AI-driven enemies, Combat mechanics, Inventory Management, Quests and Levels System, alongside additional world systems. Developed through independent implementation, customisation, and debugging using a structured UE5 tutorial as a foundation.

## Development Notes
- This repository is for documentation and presentation purposes
- Full Unreal Engine 5 project files are not included due to size and asset licensing constraints
- This project was developed using a structured Unreal Engine 5 tutorial as a foundation. All gameplay mechanics were implemented manually and extended through customisation, debugging, and adaptation across the engine versions and assets

## What I Learned
This project helped me develop a deeper understanding of systems-based design and Unreal Engine 5 workflows through hands-on implementation and iteration
- How to design and connect multiple gameplay systems using Blueprint-based architecture
- Implementing AI behaviour using perception, state logic, and animation-driven feedback
- Building and managing UI systems (inventory, menus, quest tracking) using UMG
- Structuring player progression through quests, experience and levelling systems
- Debugging Blueprint logic and adapting systems across Unreal Engine versions
- Managing large open-world environments using Landscape and Foliage tools
- Balancing scope and polish when working on a long-form, systems-heavy project
